DxInTracker
===========

Chrome Extension for tracking DX.com shipments to India.

Chrome WebStore Link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dx-shipment-tracker-for-i/kcdlapnkooffcjoamidhdbbcepoibbdj

This is mostly a learning exercise for me to learn how to write a Chrome Extension.

Features:
1) Allows to add ShipmentIds manually in the popup.
2) Displays latest event for each shipment in the popup.
3) Uses Chrome sync to sync added shipmentIds across computers.

To Do:

1) Better UI interface in the popup

  1.1) Pre-built table based on ShipmentIds being tracked

  1.2) Loading animation when refreshing status.

  1.3) Cache last query results

  1.4) Ability to delete individual ShipmentIds.

2) Allow adding ShipmentIds from DX.com order details page.
